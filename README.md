Basically,this project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game allows two players to compete against each other by selecting one of three options: rock, paper,
or scissors. The winner of each round is determined based on the game's rules, and the game keeps track of the scores until one player wins or a set number of rounds is played.

Features implemented:
User Interface: The game provides a user-friendly interface where players can easily select their choices and view the game results.
Game Logic: The JavaScript code implements the game logic, including determining the winner of each round based on the chosen options.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the scores for both players and displays them on the scoreboard.
Reset Button: Players can reset the game at any time to start a new round by clicking the reset button.
End of Game: The game ends after a set number of rounds or when one player reaches a predefined score. The winner is declared, and the game buttons are disabled.
